# Calendify

A social event planning web application used to create events and confirm the attendance of participants.

This project was created by a team of 4 people at The University of Adelaide.

I worked on the front-end of the project; the files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be found in this repository.

The entire front end is developed from scratch with the help of other team members.
